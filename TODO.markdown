# TODO

Must of the stuff is working, but there is a list of smaller
things that need to be fixed.

* Use the Exchange structure to deal with errors when resolving, esp. Timeout
* String function that works on DNS encoded strings, so the \. is handled 
    correctly;
* encoding NSEC3/NSEC bitmaps, DEcoding works;
* add functions to operate on []byte messages (raw packets) see rawmsg.go
* HIP RR (needs list of domain names, need slice for that);
* IsSubdomain, IsGlue helper functions;
* axfr/ixfr and dynamic updates;
* Cleanup?
* Multiline RRs when parsing;
* Need to define a handy zone data structure (r/b tree)?.
  - Should do glue detection
  - return rrsets
  - DNSSEC ready
* String compression *inside* the library, so the string
  miek.nl is stored once and all RRs reference it. Would be
  a major memory saver;
* Check base64/base32/hex validity when parsing RRs;
* Include os.Error in ParseError too? (more info).
* Split up the package? An idea might be:
    dns/zone        -- contains all zone parsing
    dns/server      -- server side stuff
    dns/client      -- client side stuff

## Issues

* Check the network order, it works now, but this is on Intel?
* Compression. Take stuff from Jan Mercl;

## Examples to create

* Nameserver, with a small zone, 1 KSK and online signing;
* Recursor - ala FunkenSturm?
